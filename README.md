# CHARGER BOY
A custom Li-Po battery charger/regulator PCB for the Nintendo Game Boy DMG-01


This PCB only outputs 5v, so it's only suitable for being used with IPS-Screen modded units. It is intended to replace the original regulator PCB.
As such, it also requires to be connected in a different way than the original regulator.
