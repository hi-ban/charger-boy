## A custom Li-Po battery charger/regulator PCB for the Nintendo Game Boy DMG-01.
The **Charger Boy** has been designed as an all-in-one PCB which replaces the old regulator board. It includes a more efficient regulator circuit, a battery charger, power path management, battery protection and a low battery warning function, all contained into a single board.<br>
It is designed to require as few additonal wires as possible, and little to no modding of the DMG-01 case.<br>
This board is designed to be used alongside an IPS screen mod, so it will **not** work with the original display.
